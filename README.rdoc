Another attempt at making calls to I18n#translate a bit simpler. 
This one is for views and controllers.

The features until now:

<ul>
<li>translate in the scope of the view or controller, with proper fallback</li>
<li>write missing keys to a yml file.</li>
<li>a complete list of which keys get added to your log, so you can easily check which fallbacks you could use.</li>
<li>a rake task to combine all translations in a file per locale</li>
</ul>

Planned features:

<ul>
<li>A rake task to compare translations.</li>
<li>Maybe add google translate service, like amatsuda's i18n_generators</li>
</ul>

=== Installation

This plugin is built for Rails 2.2.2 and up. It requires the ya2yaml gem to work with UTF8 properly.

  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/iain/mr.-t.git

Installing ya2yaml, add this to your <tt>config/environment.rb</tt>

  config.gem "ya2yaml"

And run, which one you prefer:

  rake gems:install
  rake gems:unpack

=== Usage

==== Translating in views or controllers

A normal case would be that the both the new- and the edit-action of a controller renders the form partial. Most of the names will be the same, but not always. Mr. T have his defaults in such a manner that you can easily manage this.

  # app/views/posts/_form.html.erb
  <%= t("Shut up, fool!") %>

will look up these keys:

<ul>
<li>posts.new.shut_up_fool # or posts.edit.save, depending on which action was run</li>
<li>posts._form.shut_up_fool</li>
<li>posts.__common.shut_up_fool</li>
<li>shut_up_fool</li>
</ul>

When working from the controller, it will be:

<ul>
<li>posts.new.shut_up_fool</li>
<li>posts.__common.shut_up_fool</li>
<li>shut_up_fool</li>
</ul>

Notice that any special characters from the key will be removed, when used as translation lookup key, but the original key will be defaulted to, and will be stored in the missing locale file.

And finally it'll serve the original string as a default, but not without writing to <tt>config/locales/missing_en.yml</tt> (depending on your locale of course).

The log will display which fallbacks have been used, so you easily check out where you can place your translations.

  Mr. T says (from /app/views/posts/_form.html.haml:3): ["posts.new.shut_up_fool", "posts._form.shut_up_fool", "posts.__common.shut_up_fool", :shut_up_fool, "Shut up, fool!"]

Notice: The t() method will be overridden by Mr. T, but the translate method doensn't. Use translate if you wish to use the old one.

==== Rake tasks

When you provide the proper translations in your missing locale files, you can add them to the combined locale files (en.yml nl.yml, de.yml, etc) using the rake task:

  rake i18n:combine

This will include all translations per locale, even the ones Rails provides and put them in their proper locale file. Old locale files will be renamed to <tt>oldfile.yml.bak</tt> where <tt>oldfile</tt> is of course the name it used to have.
